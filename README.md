DryerUI is an android application which simplifies and beautifies the UI of an existing Miele home dryer. The goal of this university semester assignment is to teach good UI appearance principles and meticulous project design.

## Design model

The project was designed using a 4-stage repeating model. Each cycle was repeated 3 times and contained the following stages:

1. Analysis
2. Design
3. Production
4. Evaluation

Analysis aims at documenting the dryer's functions, abilities and constraints. For this reason, the machine's [manual](https://www.manualslib.com/manual/2251818/Miele-T-8861-Wp-Edition-111.html#manual) was used. In addition, during the analysis stage the core user demographic of the application had to be explored. User persons were made to achieve this goal.

Afterwards, the design stage lays the basic structure of the Android application. There is no actual coding in this stage, only theoritical design.

The production stage differs in each cycle. During first of three cycles, mock-ups were made using [Figma](https://www.figma.com). In the second cycle, a prototype of the application was made and tagged using Github's release feature. You can find the prototype [here](https://github.com/KonstantinosVasilopoulos/dryer_ui/releases/tag/v1.0.0). In the third and final cycle, the application was finalized and the end-product was released. The final product is based on the second cycle's prototype and can be found [here](https://github.com/KonstantinosVasilopoulos/dryer_ui/releases/tag/v1.0.1).
